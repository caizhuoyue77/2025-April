Always aware of each other, but never able to play together.\r\n\r\nMark Cisneros (Guitar) has been in D.C. for more than a decade. He cut his teeth in Los Angeles listening to both Mary and Alec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bands, but also a healthy dose of free jazz and garage. He is the man who plays everything with everyone, but this is his band. \r\n\r\nHammered Hulls are rounded out by Chris Wilson (drums), a monstrous drummer with no shortage of love for all three of his bandmates. Every person in this band is a fan of every other person in this band. Mutual respect drives this train. To say they are an odd collection of influences is to understate the point. If you tried you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine what this band might sound like.\r\n\r\nThe band's three-song debut single was recorded in a single day at Inner Ear studios with Don Zientara and Ian MacKaye.",
