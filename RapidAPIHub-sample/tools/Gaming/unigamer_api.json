Thus the stage is set for Star Wars: Racer Revenge, bringing newer, faster, and even more dangerous Podracing to the galaxy-taking you on a one-way ride to ultimate victory. Jockey for position with a tangle of Podracing opponents or leave the pack behind at intense, nerve-jangling, planet-scorching simulated speeds of up to 600 mph. Crash and bash competitors into oblivion as you take them out of the race for good.",

The game continues the story of hero Wesley Gibson, picking up the action where the film leaves off and creating an entirely new chapter exploring both Wesley?s journey to becoming an unmatched \ufffdberassassin and the epic fiction of \"The Fraternity.\" Featuring intense third-person action, the Wanted video game will take combat to the next level with iconic moves -- such as \"Curving Bullets\" and \"Assassin Time\" -- drawn directly from the film, as well as an innovative, multi-layered cover mechanic.",

Fat the Cat longs to create what he describes as a ?Free-Dog-World,? and exactly how kidnapping M will help him with this goal remains something of a mystery, but R is determined to thwart him by rescuing M from his clutches. To enter Fat the Cat?s isolated lair, where M is being held, R needs a special key. The key can only be forged from pieces of an ancient material, which are yellow cubes. As R collects the pieces of ancient material, she will unlock new areas, and ultimately find enough pieces to assemble the key and enter the final boss?s lair to save her friend.",

Indigo Prophecy (also known as Fahrenheit) is a breakthrough in interactive narrative, teetering between the worlds of cinema and gaming while also embracing them, carving its own unique genre in the entertainment landscape. The game features a rich multilayered narrative, innovative presentation, and a chilling musical score by famed Hollywood composer Angelo Badalementi. For no apparent reason, ordinary people are randomly killing total strangers. Although there is no link between the murderers, they all seem to follow exactly the same ritual and pattern. Lucas Kane becomes one of these murderers when he kills a stranger in the men's room of a restaurant. Finding himself in control of Lucas, the player is haunted by strange visions and the desperate need to find out what is happening to him. At the same time he must keep one step ahead of the police, especially Inspector Carla Valenti and her teammate agent Tyler Miles.",

Inhale enough enemies and you can launch one huge Blaster Bullet capable of wiping out a troop of Waddle Dees. Now's your chance to battle iconic bosses like Kracko Jr and King Dedede in 3D! Inhaling multiple enemies to launch Blaster Bullets is a great way to pump up your score and go for a bronze, silver, or gold star. Another way to score big is to rack up a combo by continuously firing at enemies without missing. Or you could always just collect coins as you jump across platforms. As you progress, you'll unlock EX stages, which provide a tougher challenge to master. Celebrate your victories by tapping a Kirby series Amiibo figure to build a statue in the plaza that plays new music!",

Your job is a little too tough for any one man to pull off on his own, so you'll have a loyal group of soldiers and a slew of weaponry including the Liberator Pistol, Panzerschreck, MG42, and B.A.R. all of which will come to your aid in the heat of battle. Divided into five main missions, the gameplay is extensive and meticulously constructed, resulting in an experience that trumps earlier series installments.",

You can race with the legendary 125 Desmo (1958) or with the 500 Pantah (1970), the beautiful 750 F1 (1980), but also with the first Monster 900 (1990) or the various evolutions of the \"naked\" par excellence, such as the high-performance Monster S4RS Tricolore. The Superbikes had to be incorporated of course and include the 848 (2000) and the highly exclusive 1199 Panigale Superleggera (2014), as well as the Desmosecidici GP15 ridden by Andrea Doviszioso and many Ducati production milestone models. You can compete on 5 road tracks (Stelvio Park, Kanto Temples, Sierra Nevada, French Riviera and North Wales) and on 8 faithfully reproduced racetracks (Imola, Potrero de Los Funes, Alm\ufffdria, Road America, Magny Cours, Donington and Sugo). Also part of the game, the track that is dearest to the Ducati fans, the Misano World Circuit \"Marco Simoncelli\", the setting for so many legendary races, but also for the nine editions of World Ducati Week, the famous gathering that, every two years, brings together Ducatisti from all over the world. Ducati is all about passion, but also history, and it is here that the Museum comes into play, included in a racing videogame for the very first time. A space entirely dedicated to those fans and enthusiasts who wish to discover all the technical and historical details and interesting facts that have made each of the bikes so famous, bikes that have contributed to writing the best and most unforgettable pages of Ducati's history.",

The Jedi starfighter is the ship of choice for the Jedi, and unlike any other in the Star Wars universe. By virtue of a Jedi pilot, players will have a variety of unique Force powers at their fingertips throughout various points in the game. Force lightning saps the power systems of enemy ships and renders pilots unconscious. Force shield creates an energy barrier that deflects laser blasts. Force reflex simulates exaggerated reflexes and perception of the Jedi Knight pilot by putting the world in slow motion while the Jedi starship retains normal turning and shooting abilities. Force shockwave produces a powerful energy surge, which radiates multi-directionally. Jedi Starfighter introduces players to the two main characters and their starships through a mini-training campaign. In one-player mode, players will fly as Adi Gallia and Nym. Adi Gallia, a well-respected and very skillful Jedi Master, pilots the Jedi starfighter. Nym, a former pirate who has become a powerful rebel leader, flies the Havoc, which has been upgraded from the original game with three new weapons: cruise missiles, cluster missiles, and proximity mines. Two-player cooperative mode features additional supporting characters and ships",

The game delivers new gametypes, a signature art style powered by Valve's next generation animation technology, persistent player statistics, and more. Unlike other \"class-based\" games that offer a variety of combat classes only, Team Fortress 2 packs a wild variety of classes which provide a broad range of tactical abilities and personalities, and lend themselves to a variety of player skills. Play as the flame-throwing Pyro, the room clearing Heavy, or the Spy, a master of disguises. Other classes include: Scout, Sniper, Medic, Engineer, Demoman, or Soldier. Team Fortress 2 was first included with the release of Half-Life 2's Orange Box. Now, each game from that pack is available as its own boxed title for gamers to pick and choose their favorites.",

                        "description": "Can a 22nd century marine save the Union Aerospace Corporation's Mars Research Facility from the forces of hell? Find out as the first-person shooter series DOOM continues in DOOM 3. In this critically acclaimed action-horror re-telling of the original DOOM , players must battle their way through a demon-infested facility before entering the abyss to battle Hell's mightiest warrior -- and put an end to the invasion. Distinguishing itself from previous titles, the third game in the series focuses more on an engrossing single player experience. In addition to its frenzied first-person shooter action, it also scares the wits out of players as they tremble down dark corridors filled with gruesome zombies and monsters ready to attack from the shadows. To survive the horror that Hell has unleashed on Mars, players have to use their flashlight in the pitch-black corridors and dank research labs to light up the dark corners where rabid hellions may be hiding, then fire away with lethal weapons and hope you splatter the enemy before they tear you apart. Doom 3 features realistic physics, immersive surround-sound, and real-time dynamic lighting and shadows that create an environment of ever-changing fear and uncertainty.",

A calibration room will allow you get comfortable in VR but once you call the elevator, you begin your story as patient no. 6079 in The Greenwater Institute, with no recollection of who you are or what you did to be here. Dark visions bring your lucidity into question and only the doctor?s supply of medication can suppress those who wish to haunt you. Gameplay is a seamless weave of interaction and narrative that wraps exploration and tense horror in rich environmental storytelling to create something that is unique to VR.",

Fat the Cat longs to create what he describes as a ?Free-Dog-World,? and exactly how kidnapping M will help him with this goal remains something of a mystery, but R is determined to thwart him by rescuing M from his clutches. To enter Fat the Cat?s isolated lair, where M is being held, R needs a special key. The key can only be forged from pieces of an ancient material, which are yellow cubes. As R collects the pieces of ancient material, she will unlock new areas, and ultimately find enough pieces to assemble the key and enter the final boss?s lair to save her friend.",

Indigo Prophecy (also known as Fahrenheit) is a breakthrough in interactive narrative, teetering between the worlds of cinema and gaming while also embracing them, carving its own unique genre in the entertainment landscape. The game features a rich multilayered narrative, innovative presentation, and a chilling musical score by famed Hollywood composer Angelo Badalementi. For no apparent reason, ordinary people are randomly killing total strangers. Although there is no link between the murderers, they all seem to follow exactly the same ritual and pattern. Lucas Kane becomes one of these murderers when he kills a stranger in the men's room of a restaurant. Finding himself in control of Lucas, the player is haunted by strange visions and the desperate need to find out what is happening to him. At the same time he must keep one step ahead of the police, especially Inspector Carla Valenti and her teammate agent Tyler Miles.",

God Hand combines a \"hard boiled\" atmosphere with humorous elements in a \"comical, violent\" action game directed by Shinji Mikami (Resident Evil 4) and produced by Atsushi Inaba (Phoenix Wright). The game follows a kind, aimless traveler named Jean who, after attempting to save a girl from some sort of danger, gets his right arm chopped off by a mercenary. Somehow, he comes into posession of the God Hand, the legendary gold-glowing hand of a great savior from olden times. Now, Jean has the power to save the world, but also has the scum of the land after him. The game is filled with wild combat as Jean uses his newly-earned skills in fighting and leaping, and the power of the glowing God Hand can charge up and give him new skills. The game also includes lots of comical gags for an over-the-top experience of violence and hilarity.",

With Final Fantasy VII's historic release on PlayStation in June of 1997, role-playing games were finally given the respect that they deserved and the RPG genre is now one of the most significant and defining on the system. Following the story of Cloud Strife, gamers were taking on a fantastical journey that encompassed three CDs and over 40 hours worth of gameplay. The game continued the trend of using the series' staple turn-based battle system, complete with melee and elaborate magic attacks.",

A bold new direction in open-world freedom, storytelling, mission-based gameplay and online multiplayer, Grand Theft Auto V focuses on the pursuit of the almighty dollar in a re-imagined, present-day Southern California. Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.",

While my view of the world and women from way back in the 1980s collides with modern reality harder than the breasts of a lusciously stacked blonde jogging along a beach, I?m all set to date my way across the modern world! In a point & click adventure I?d call typical for the genre we mutually experience how I fall head-over-heels in love with Faith, the hot-to-trot assistant to the boss at Prune, a technology enterprise successful worldwide. Since even dating is done digitally nowadays, the first thing I have to do is to work on my score at Timber, the totally hip, can?t-get-anywhere-without-it dating app where I date women, satisfy their needs, and accordingly pick up points for my Timber profile.

Even so, it comes as a shock when he is summoned to his family?s ancestral home in the Scottish highlands, after his father has taken his own life there. David does not know much about his father?s final weeks, but the circumstances of his death seem more than peculiar. Settling the heritage is merely an excuse for David to find out more about the castle his father grew up in, meeting the family he never knew and for shedding light on the mysteries surrounding his father?s death. Black Mirror is a modern re-imagining of the acclaimed gothic-horror adventure series. Tormented by nightmares and waking dreams for all his life, David fears that it might be his destiny to follow in his father?s footsteps, down a path that leads to madness and death. Is there really a curse that has been haunting his family for generations as his father believed? Or are the mysteries hidden inside the cold walls of Black Mirror house of a far more wordly nature? It is up to David to uncover the horrible truths, buried under generations of silence and fathoms of stone.",
