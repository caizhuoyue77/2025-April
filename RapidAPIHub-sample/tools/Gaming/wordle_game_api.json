    "tool_description": "The Wordle Game API allows developers to integrate a fun word-guessing game into their applications. Players can make guesses of five-letter English words, and the API will return a string indicating which letters are correct, which are incorrect but present in the word, and which are not present at all. The API generates a new secret word every 24 hours to keep the game fresh and challenging.",
