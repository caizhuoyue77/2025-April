But those that Grit through that first attack, or avoid it via other mechanisms, will take a bigger chunk of damage,\u201d said Combat Designer Josh Hurley.</p>\r\n<p>While we're talking New World, Wave 2.2 of the PTR patch notes are <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1063730/view/5475861744260204580?l=english\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">up on Steam</a> as well.

So does <a href=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/topic/throne-liberty\">Throne and Liberty</a>, the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/games/mmorpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MMORPG</a> developed by NCSoft for PC and mobile platforms, cut the mustard?</p>\r\n<p>Yes. The game is obviously an MMO. No argument there. But we\u2019re actually here to talk about something else. In this series, we look at games that teeter between falling into the not-so-cut-and-dried MMO category and the run-of-the-mill multiplayer genre. Why? Because the term \u201cMMO\u201d means both everything and nothing in the gaming industry today. We\u2019re trying to make sense of that phrase we all know and love (or hate). Most of the time it comes down to numbers \u2014 the amount of people that can play together \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/is-an-mmo-6-bungie-itself-labels-destiny-2-an-mmo-i-m-not-sure-why\">yet sometimes an MMO doesn\u2019t feel like an MMO</a>\u2026or, on the flipside, <a href=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/is-an-mmo-8-sea-of-thieves-lacks-massive-part-but-makes-up-vibes\">sometimes a non-MMO does feel like an MMO</a>.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"type:primaryImage aligncenter size-large\" src=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/file/2023/6/throne-liberty-raid-812x456.jpg\" alt=\"throne and liberty raid\" width=\"812\" height=\"456\" /></p>\r\n<p>Throne and Liberty made waves when it was first revealed, but the game has received negative feedback following its beta test. Despite looking amazing, players have criticized Throne and Liberty for its tab-target combat system, which feels outdated compared to modern MMOs. This disappointment stems from the initial expectation of a fast-paced and dynamic action game. However, let\u2019s put aside this complaint.</p>\r\n<p>What I want to talk about is \u201cAstral Hunting,\u201d Throne and Liberty\u2019s autoplay system. This functionality allows players to perform actions without having to do so manually. Simply put, the game plays itself for you from a grinding perspective. Now, this feature is not new. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/topic/black-desert-online\">Black Desert Online</a> has included something like it for years now. In that game, you can make your character fish while you go AFK. There\u2019s also autopathing \u2014 where your character travels to a waypoint selected on the map, and autolooping \u2014 which is the same thing but with a return point, letting the character traverse back and forth indefinitely. Black Desert Online even takes things a step further in its mobile version by letting players autohunt, grinding levels by killing mobs without having to lift a finger or even be on your phone.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"type:primaryImage aligncenter size-large\" src=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/file/2023/6/throne-liberty-pvp-812x456.jpg\" alt=\"throne and liberty pvp\" width=\"812\" height=\"456\" /></p>\r\n<p>The thing is though, do people really consider Black Desert Mobile a true MMO? In my opinion, it\u2019s just another mobile game, like Candy Crush. So when you put an autoplay feature in an MMO that goes beyond fishing or pathing, are the developers really doing the PC players any favors? Or are they just catering to the mobile folks? Because, in case you weren\u2019t aware, <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220525005651/en\">mobile gaming dominates the gaming market</a>, accounting for 61% of overall revenue and surpassing PC (and console) gaming. And that gap is only widening as the years go on.</p>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s bring it back now. Astral Hunting in Throne and Liberty lets players autohunt just like in Black Desert Mobile, but on PC too. They can enter \u201cauto-combat\u201d and just sit at their computer with their feet up watching their character fight enemies. It doesn\u2019t stop there though, because the game allows auto-combat while offline for up to 8 hours a day, too. How, you might ask? Well, through the purchase of the battle pass, of course. Now, you can argue this system isn\u2019t unfair, nor pay-to-win, since there\u2019s no advantage besides saving time. But let\u2019s be real, Astral Hunting completely undermines the fundamental principles of the MMORPG experience. Throne and Liberty may be an MMO by definition, but practically it\u2019s just going to be a mobile game that\u2019s accessible via PC.</p>",

This can be picked up via <a title=\"Undawn Steam\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1881700/Undawn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steam</a> or the <a title=\"Undawn site\" href=\"https://www.undawn.game\">game\u2019s official site</a>.</p>\r\n<p>A defining feature of Undawn is the inclusion of Will Smith as the NPC Trey Jones. Jones serves as a guide for players, helping them navigate the world. As with most survival games, players who team up and work together will have a better chance at surviving \u2013 whether it be in PvP or PvE.</p>\r\n<p>The game takes place four years after a global disaster and players will find themselves dealing not just with other survivors but the infected that have overrun the world. It\u2019s a big world, with a variety of environments. Players will be able to build defenses (and homes) using a free building system with over 1,000 different items, but as with everything else, they\u2019ll need to work together to do it.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBSTcMwGW0o\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>",

One of the major highlights is the addition of a new job called Khali. She is a Flora character that utilizes LUK as her primary stat. Khali\u2019s primary weapon is Chakram, and her secondary weapon is the Hex Seeker. Unfortunately though, folks must wait until June 28 to start playing as the Wind of Vengeance.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime however, Wonky the Fairy and his friends are hosting a variety of events at their restaurant, Wongstaurant, from June 14 to August 2. Players can earn rewards by completing story quests, daily, weekly, and season missions, or by purchasing items from the Coin Shop. The Special Menu changes every week, and it features a variety of dishes that can be purchased with Wongstaurant Coins. Some of the rewards include rings, scrolls, and damage skins. These Wongstaurant events are also a way to easily level characters.</p>\r\n<p>Something else that\u2019s happening as of yesterday (until November 14) is yet another Burning event, which allows players to create or use existing characters between Levels 200 and 248 to receive Hyper Burning. These characters level up three levels at a time and receive special rewards alongside progression (up to Level 250). There\u2019s also the Burning World, a unique and time-limited world designed to aid players in leveling up rapidly on top of the Burning effect. It offers various advantages, such as accelerated experience gain, lower monster difficulty, and access to exclusive events and rewards through the Step Up event. Come August 30, the Burning World will go away and then players will have two weeks to transfer up to five characters over Level 150 to non-Reboot worlds through World Leap.</p>\r\n<p>It doesn't stop there too; there\u2019s even more events on the way.</p>\r\n<p>From June 28 to August 29, Khali's Journey will begin. By creating a Khali character, players will earn various rewards at different levels, including a Lil Khali pet package, equipment boxes, titles, symbol selectors, and growth potions. In addition, there\u2019s Khali's Wish, another event where players at Level 101 and above can participate once per account after reaching level 200 on Khali. By defeating enemies near your level and attending for a total of 20 days, players can earn rewards such as rings, damage skins, chairs, emblems, and a Zealot set.</p>\r\n<p>Also, Miracle Time is a 24-hour event that occurs on select days, allowing players to double their chances of ranking up item potentials using Cash Cubes, with different item types being affected on different dates. On the other hand, Sunny Sunday is an event where players at Level 101 and above can log in on specific Sundays to enjoy various perks such as increased experience, double rewards, and discounted enhancements. Lastly, Spell Trace Fever Time is a limited-time event that increases the success rate of equipment upgrades during specific time slots in non-Reboot worlds.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the Jett Job Advancement will take place during \u201cthe second part\u201d of the Savior update, according to Nexon.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Besides events though, several skill improvements have been made across different jobs. These enhancements aim to balance and refine existing skills, ensuring a more enjoyable and engaging gameplay experience for players, according to Nexon. Additionally, the required EXP to level up in the Level 220 - 259 range has been decreased by various percentages. Moreover, the Arcane River Special Content has become weekly, offering three plays per week, with adjusted EXP rewards and symbol coupons. Furthermore, there are improvements to various aspects such as Monster Park, equipment enhancement, Lachelein, and character stats. There\u2019s plenty of bug fixes too.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://maplestory.nexon.net/news/83731/updated-6-13-v-242-savior-khali-wind-of-vengeance-patch-notes\">Check out the patch notes for more details on all of the information mentioned above</a>.</p>",

This will be their third, and \u201cbiggest\u201d playtest so far. The objective is to see how the game handles a lot of players. To that end, they\u2019re inviting more than 200,000 players to attend. If you were already part of one of the other tests, your invite is guaranteed. For everyone else, you have some time to sign up. (That means filling out a survey.)</p>\r\n<p>Since this is more or less a <a title=\"Palia Stress Test\" href=\"https://palia.com/news/alpha-stress-test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">server stress test</a>, it won\u2019t be too long. In fact, it\u2019s only going to last for four hours \u2013 from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM Pacific time. Players who didn\u2019t participate in the last Alpha tests will need to sign up soon as invites will be going out over the next two weeks. Once someone receives their invite, it will take them to an account creation page where they can do all the necessary stuff. And yes, this test is under NDA.</p>",

The upcoming Story Missions, set during the invasion of the Null Sector, will be part of the upcoming Season 6: Invasion. These missions take place in Rio de Janeiro, Toronto, and Gothenburg and feature large maps, in-depth storylines, and intense battles against new enemy types like Annihilators and Stalkers.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>\"We typically don't go into depth in-game with our stories,\" game director Aaron Keller told <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2023/06/12/exclusive-first-hands-on-with-the-pve-story-missions\">Game Informer</a>. That changes though with the upcoming missions, as they focus on the moment when Overwatch gets back together and answers Winston's recall.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>In Toronto, for example, the player fights off waves of Null Sector grunts and artillery bots to protect an evac ship. New enemy types, such as Stalkers and Subjugators, pose challenges during the mission. According to Game Informer, the gameplay lasts around 31 minutes, showcasing the massive map size and diverse battles. Also, the missions allow for different character interactions and unique story elements based on the selected heroes.</p>\r\n<p>The Story Missions will be released as part of the Overwatch 2: Invasion Bundle, which costs $15 and includes the three missions, a Legendary skin for Sojourn, Overwatch Coins, and access to Sojourn for new players that joined after her inclusion. The Ultimate Invasion Bundle costs $40, however, yet adds the Null Sector Premium Battle Pass, additional skins, and bonuses. Also, there's a bonus co-op mission called \"Underworld\" set in King's Row, a new PvP mode called Flashpoint, and Hero Mastery missions.</p>\r\n<p>\"[Season 6] is definitely bigger,\" Keller said, in comparison to previous seasons. \"We don't want to save up content and save it for these giant releases years down that line; that's what a box release would be for a game.\u201d The team repurposed some of the canceled Hero Missions into other content, and Keller hinted at reusing more of it in the future. This new season, which starts August 10, marks a significant content drop and aims to shift the live-service focus beyond just hero and map releases. The team plans to release more Story Missions and incorporate player feedback for future missions.</p>\r\n<p><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #3e3f3a; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;

According to the developers, the expansion \u2014 which authentically represents Korean culture \u2014 offers breathtaking landscapes, intricate architecture, challenging boss battles, and a rich narrative experience with non-linear quest lines. Players can enjoy 80 cutscenes, 40 vignettes, and 6,000 fully-dubbed lines.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of gameplay, \"Land of the Morning Light\" introduces eight bosses that players must defeat to progress through the narrative. Each boss has unique mechanics and combat strategies. Additionally, a new competitive boss challenge called \"Boss Blitz\" has been added. After defeating a boss, players can engage in up to 10 customized \"Calamity\" difficulty levels and compete with others for top rankings organized by character class.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the expansion also brings quality-of-life improvements, including powerful gear and specialty items to enhance gameplay. Players can look forward to acquiring items like \"Dahn's Gloves,\" the \"Belt of Taebaek,\" the \"Jewel of Illusion,\" and the \"Deboreka Earring.\" Housing options have also been expanded, providing larger indoor and outdoor social gathering spaces. \"Shimhyangje,\" a spacious manor with generously sized rooms and traditional furniture, is among the new housing structures. Also, the revamped \"Panokseon\" boat offers a sea-faring experience with combat capabilities and ability to accommodate a large crew.</p>\r\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/games/mmorpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MMORPG</a>'s expansion is free for Black Desert Online owners, the base game is something you'd have to buy if you aren't an owner already. However, in celebration of the launch, all game packages will be available at a 50% discount on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/582660/Black_Desert/\">Steam</a> and through <a href=\"https://payment.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/Pay/Package/\">the official website</a>.

If you missed hearing about that one, they initially announced the event would be held on June 28. Rather than cramming everything into that one date, the dev team has decided to add two more. That means two more chances for those who may not get in the first time to join later. These are July 12 and July 26. In the case of the first two, the game will run from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM CEST. The last event will run 24/7 \u2013 which means just rolling into full Early Access at that point.</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind, this is an NFT game. That means those interested in participating will need a wallet registered with Blink Galaxy. If you want in, you\u2019ll have to create the wallet first and provide some \u201cpersonal information\u201d along with the address. They\u2019ll also need to either purchase an Outer Ring NFT \u2013 via Lootboxes or the in-game marketplace \u2013 or have at least 100,000 Galactic Quadrant tokens in their wallet. Effectively, you\u2019re spending money if you want in.</p>",

The Conquest map has seen layout and visual tweaks and three new features have been added to the <a href=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/games/moba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MOBA</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The Conquest map has seen a visual update to a more chilling, darker atmosphere to match the Season of Souls in Smite. The layout has been tweaked with improvements to lane size, jungle paths, and more. The Stygian Tower and Unleashed Titans have been added to Conquest, and Sould Surge has been added to all game modes.</p>\r\n<p>Along with all this comes a new Battle Pass with all new rewards players can earn. It of course features both a free and premium track. Unlock bonuses and skins along the way.</p>\r\n<p>Also added are four color-changing skins that you can customize with the dye of your choice. There's a skin available to purchase for Cthulhu, Ra, and Fenrir, and a Cupid skin you can unlock for free via quests.</p>\r\n<p>Check out the new cinematic trailer for Smite's Season of Souls.

According to <a href=\"https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-with-immediate-implementation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a letter posted on the company website by its CEO</a>, Embracer is now restructuring to become \u201ca leaner, stronger and a more focused, self-sufficient company\u201d.</p>\r\n<p>That\u2019s more or less a fancy way of saying they\u2019re done the mergers and acquisitions phase and will now begin cutting costs. People are being laid off. At present, the number of people being let go hasn\u2019t been specified, nor has which companies these changes will impact. Although the letter does note that the company currently \u201cengages\u201d around 17,000 people.</p>\r\n<p>These layoffs will probably not all happen at once either. In the letter, the CEO outlines the phases of their plan. These are intended to take place over a period lasting until March 2024. There are three phases in all, two of which start now and seem to be more assessment. The last phase will \u201cfocus on internal consolidation, further resource utilization, and more synergies\u201d. Basically, it seems like employees have a bit of time \u2013 and some warning \u2013 before they start letting people go.</p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s not great news for plans of employed game developers, but it\u2019s also not anything we\u2019re not familiar with. After all, we\u2019ve been watching EA and Activision do this for years.</p>",

The expansion, announced during the recent Xbox Games Showcase, will be released in monthly installments starting from July 20.

First, the good news\u2026 The <a title=\"Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" href=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/topic/texas-chain-saw-massacre\">Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a> will be launching with crossplay. Sumo dropped a post on <a title=\"Texas Chain Saw Massacre Blog\" href=\"https://www.txchainsawgame.com/hub/crossplay-explained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the game\u2019s blog</a> today detailing how it would work \u2013 specifically, which platforms can matchmake with each other. Anyone with a current-gen system is covered. That means Steam, Windows, Xbox X|S, and PlayStation 5 can all play together. Xbox One and PlayStation 4 players will have to live without matchmaking.</p>\r\n<p>Now, for the (potentially) bad news. It really depends on how much you care about this one, particular feature. There will be no cross-progression. Progress and saves will be tied to the platform the player is on at the time. Sorry guys.</p>",

Today may have been the best thing Skull and Bones have produced so far, and it wasn't even gameplay. It was the band Home Free who took the stage and sang a chilling sea shanty about the game. On the gameplay side of things, an open beta is incoming for Skull and Bones and will be running from August 25-28 (as long as there are no more delays of course).</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cUjxVKjXp5o\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/topic/xdefiant\">XDefiant</a> was featured pretty early on in the presentation.

These kinds of requests are rare though, with only 12 out of 646 petitions being granted last year.</p>\r\n<p>\"The panel compounded its error by affirming a nationwide UCL (California's Unfair Competition Law) injunction in a case brought by an individual, non-representative plaintiff that did not even establish injury to itself, let alone the kind of injury justifying classwide relief,\" <a href=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/movakgjawva/Apple%20petition%20en%20banc%202023.pdf\">Apple wrote in its petition</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Apple argues that Epic Games did not provide enough evidence of harm caused by its practices, while Epic Games argues that the April ruling in favor of Apple sets an unfair precedent and undermines antitrust laws. In case you were not aware, Apple won its appeal against Epic Games' antitrust lawsuit, despite being\u00a0 found to be in violation of California's anti-steering law.</p>\r\n<p>\"That high bar could perhaps work if the competitive benefits and harms of the walled-garden approach are robustly considered at a final balancing step,\" <a href=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/lbpggaolnpq/Epic%20-%20en%20banc%20petition%20-%202023-06-07.pdf\">Epic Games wrote in its petition</a>. \"But it plainly undermines the antitrust laws to adopt a rule where any practice that saves administrative costs is ultimately greenlighted, no matter how exclusionary it is or how much consumer harm it generates.\"</p>",

Sometimes games are just released too early and are buggy messes, and sometimes the player base just doesn't get invested in an MMO. Whatever the cause, the following games failed to meet expectations, and most have gone the way of the dinosaur, though there are a couple still up and running today.</p>\r\n<p>This is our list of the Top 10 Biggest MMO Failures of All Time.</p>\r\n<h2>The Matrix Online</h2>\r\n<p>The Matrix Online was billed as the sequel to the highly successful film franchise. It promised to immerse players in the world of the Matrix, creating your own super-powered combatant to take on the machines. Instead what we got was an uninspired MMO with little to no redeeming qualities.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jx3i8mG-Q-M\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>Hellgate: London</h2>\r\n<p>Hellgate: London had a huge marketing push going into the release, but that didn't stop the game from being a lackluster game that while not terrible, didn't do anything special either. It boasted an odd subscription model and poor customer service. The company began laying off employees within a couple of months of launch before a bank seizure ended the game after just over a year of life. You gotta feel bad for those who bought into the lifetime subscriptions.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oixARdpajp0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>Gods And Heroes: Rome Rising</h2>\r\n<p>I'd wager there are a fair few of you out there that haven't heard of this one, but I vividly remember playing Gods and Heroes: Rome Rising when the original developer was working on the game, as well as when the second developer picked it up and tried to bring it back to life. Unfortunately, a unique setting couldn't keep this MMO afloat for long under either developer, and it finally died its final death.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLyhNxCmC7g\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>Wildstar</h2>\r\n<p>Wildstar had all the hype going into its launch, but its focus on \"hardcore\" really set it back with the general gaming audience. Add to that the uninspired questing and Wildstar ended up making the switch to free-to-play in an attempt to salvage the game. It became a running joke every year regarding when Wildstar was going to shut down. It finally did, bringing a sigh from its remaining player base.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-NXdWk9sm8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning</h2>\r\n<p>You would think a hugely popular IP like Warhammer would get bring in the players, but Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning never really found its legs. Originally reviewed quite well, the player base simply drifted off within a couple of years and the game was left barren and lifeless. The heavy focus on PvP did not help it maintain a mainstream audience, and soon Warhammer Online went extinct.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JglnSrfJtyQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>APB: All Points Bulletin</h2>\r\n<p>APB tried to be Grand Theft Auto Online before GTA Online ever existed. What players actually got was a buggy mess of a game with poor controls and an uninspired game world. The original APB shut down a year after launch and was eventually picked up by Reloaded Production who re-released the game as a free-to-play title that does still exist today, although it still only garners a \"Mixed\" review score on Steam.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTAnRQbiHGc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>Star Wars Galaxies</h2>\r\n<p>Despite its flaws, Star Wars Galaxies was THE Star Wars game for quite some time. An intricate profession system and player-driven world kept fans engaged and immersed in the Star Wars universe. Then the NGE update happened and killed the game dead. Players left in droves, Sony lost the rights to the Star Wars IP, and Star Wars: The Old Republic happened. It all meant death for Star Wars Galaxies.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jf3Kzhwx0zU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>Vanguard: Saga of Heroes</h2>\r\n<p>Several developers behind the original Everquest were behind the development of Vanguard: Saga of Heroes. There were a ton of races and classes, intricate crafting, boat travel, and much more. Unfortunately, the game's publishing deal with Microsoft fell through. Sony Online Entertainment jumped in and forced the game to release earlier than planned, to the dismay of everyone. As you can imagine it was an incomplete buggy mess on release. They tried free-to-play but it was too late by that point and the game is now gone.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bfwDlvZQpEI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>Final Fantasy XIV</h2>\r\n<p>Why is one of the most successful MMOs of all time on the list of all-time failures? Well, it's because the original state of <a href=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/topic/final-fantasy-xiv\">Final Fantasy XIV</a> at launch was simply unacceptable to the players and for once the devs listened, rebuilt the game's systems from the ground up, and relaunched the game as A Realm Reborn, which would go on to become the MMORPG juggernaut it is today. So there you go, at least one happy ending on this list of sadness.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/39j5v8jlndM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h2>Tabula Rasa</h2>\r\n<p>Stop me if you've heard this one before. Richard Garriott tried to do something after Ultima Online and it didn't work out. Lawsuits were filed, inner turmoil reigned supreme, and what could have been something unique in the MMORPG genre died a painful death. Tabula Rasa was supposed to be the Sci-fi MMO everyone was waiting for. Instead, it passed into history as one of the biggest MMO failures of all time.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w52huJgc6Ck\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>And that's our list of the Top MMO Failures of all time. Is there an MMO failure that breaks your heart or that you just find funny? Let us know in the comments below.</p>",

The conquest map is being updated, most power items are getting nerfed alongside some of the more meta gods in the rotation. There are buffs to plenty of other gods to go along with that, and the power nerfs should mean a passive buff for tanks in the game.</p>\r\n<p>There will be a new Season Pass and plenty of new skins to collect as well, but what caught my attention today was the soundtrack video Titan Forge Games released today for the Smite Season of Souls. It's honestly sick AF. I'm listening to it now as I type this. Heavy metal tunes rock out in my earholes and my happiness levels are going up and up.</p>\r\n<p>Check out the soundtrack below if you're even slightly a metalhead. I think you'll like what you hear. I'm not usually one to have the music on in Smite, but I'll make an exception once this soundtrack hits the game.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LtI5kH7B5nU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>",

Clementine is a support hero that uses \u201cmagical fusion cooking\u201d to aid her allies in combat. She comes with a self-frying pan \u2013 which apparently means she has no need of a stove to cook on to get the job done. Good thing, really. Who wants to drag a stove around in combat.</p>\r\n<p>Clementine was revealed in a video earlier today as part of Summer Game Fest along with two other heroes, the Chaos Mage Sydian and the Weather Mage Sky. Don\u2019t let Sydian\u2019s Chaos Mage title fool you. He\u2019s actually a tank. Just\u2026 Apparently, one that likes to do his job from a distance. Sky makes use of water and lightning abilities in combat. Not at the same time though\u2026 That would probably be bad for her.</p>\r\n<p>For Clementine\u2019s part, she\u2019ll be doing her cooking on the battlefield, with players picking three ingredients to cook together and create a dish that provides benefits in combat. Players will need to cook the food properly \u2013 it can be over or under-done \u2013 and do it all while dodging attacks and beating up the enemy with their frying pan. Note that improperly cooked food will not provide the same buffs as food that\u2019s done right.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jOZ7PRq5CSs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>",

As the LCSPA post points out, the terms don\u2019t quite address all the issues, but they go a way to guaranteeing Riot\u2019s support for a new format of the NACL and its players. The organization will receive improved financial support, and players will receive a bit more protection. Among the agreed-upon terms is $300,000 to be split between the 10 NACL teams during the remainder of the 2023 season, sharing 50% of all future NACL sponsorship with NACL teams, requiring teams to meet minimum standards in order to receive payments from Riot, a minimum of 30 days\u2019 severance pay for those earning 1.5 times the league\u2019s minimum salary, and shared representation on a committee to allow players to help decide on any future changes.</p>\r\n<p>According to the LCSPA\u2019s letter, they remain committed to their goal of addressing the impact Riot\u2019s decision has already had on NACL players. This is just a step in the right direction.</p>",

The new Daru transformation skill opens up a bunch of new abilities to players, including increased movement while riding a donkey mount, the ability to breathe underwater, and a 20% swim speed boost \u2013 among others. It all sounds pretty useful, but there is a catch. Transforming into Daru means you\u2019re less equipped for fighting. These little guys aren\u2019t really big on combat. They\u2019re here to explore, gather, mine, farm, and the like. So, maybe avoid the PvP.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking of which\u2026 10v10 time wars anyone? There are no factions in this fight. It\u2019s all about the flags. Players are split into groups by flag color and must collect these flags as they appear and take them back to the base. The first team to hit the 250-point mark wins.</p>\r\n<p>Another important thing hitting this month is the \u201cMake a Splash\u201d global arena beta service. Players from Korea, Asia, North America, and Europe will be able to create teams and participate in arena events. Remember, this is a test. Once it\u2019s over, the devs will take the information back and make improvements.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAVweH6dOX0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>",

Also, this change was made as the company announced a new game recently: <a href=\"https://www.mmobomb.com/topic/marathon\">Marathon</a>. Therefore, going forward the weekly Destiny blog will now be announced on official Destiny social channels, though Bungie will also occasionally release standalone blogs.</p>\r\n<p>Anyways, there will be a Community Fashion Contest happening to celebrate the Season of the Deep. Guardians are encouraged to showcase their best fashion combinations using five pieces of armor and share them with the hashtag #DrownInTheDrip. The incentive is a chance to earn the exclusive Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter fashion emblem, and the deadline for submissions is June 15.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the Grandmaster Nightfalls will be available earlier than usual during the Season of the Deep. Starting on Week 4, players will have the opportunity to earn Exotic materials and Adept weapons. However, the Conqueror gilding node will open in Week 7. The Wendigo GL3 Heavy Grenade Launcher, Loaded Question Fusion Rifle, and Braytech Osprey Rocket Launcher will be featured in the coming weeks.</p>\r\n<p>The Crucible game mode Supremacy, which involves collecting crests dropped by enemies and denying the enemy points by picking up fallen ally crests, will be added to the Relentless rotator next week. Players can earn ranks and have a chance to obtain Randy's Throwing Knife Kinetic Scout Rifle from Shaxx's loot pool.</p>\r\n<p>Aside from all that, Bungie acknowledged the popularity of the Last Wish raid during the first week of the Season of the Deep. Players spent a total of 2.17 million hours in the raid, surpassing the activity's launch week in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/the_first_twid_06_08_2023\">the full post</a> for more information, including some fixes.</p>",

If they were, it would seem unlikely that Pockepair would be dropping a new trailer at Summer Game Fest today. But they did. And it has pretty much everything you\u2019d expect after having seen previous trailers for the game.</p>\r\n<p>It also has something you probably wouldn\u2019t have expected, a new Early Access launch window. No, you won\u2019t be getting your hands on the game this year. Rather, it will launch on Steam Early Access sometime in January 2024.</p>\r\n<p>That might be a disappointment to those of you who were looking forward to running your own gunbunckle sweatshops, but Pockepair <a title=\"Palworld Summer Games Fest Trailer\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/3693561465116664377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assures players</a> the decision was made so they could \u201cdeliver the best experience possible, combining survival, crafting, monster catching and breeding into one exciting game in the best possible condition\u201d. Effectively, the game needs more time to cook. Still, time passes quickly, so unless early access is rescheduled again, you\u2019ll be playing before you know it.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXhfwoPJfm0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"709\" height=\"418\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></p>",
